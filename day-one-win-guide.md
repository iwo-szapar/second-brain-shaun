## Your Day-One Win

**Goal**: Ability to produce quality content requiring minimal editing
**Test**: Create one social media post for a doctor client
**Success**: Post requires < 30 minutes editing (vs current several hours)
**Time Investment**: 45-60 minutes total (setup + generation + editing)

---

## Prerequisites (15 minutes)

### 1. Choose Your Primary Doctor Client
Pick one doctor you create content for regularly.

### 2. Document Their Brand Voice
**File**: `memory/style-voice/doctor-[name].md`

**Fill in these sections:**
```markdown
# Dr. [Name] - Brand Voice

## Voice Characteristics
- Tone: [Professional / Empathetic / Authoritative]
- Formality: [Casual / Professional / Academic]
- Key Themes: [What they emphasize]

## Sounds Like
- "[Actual phrase from their past post]"
- "[Another characteristic phrase]"
- "[Unique expression]"

## Doesn't Sound Like
- "[Generic medical jargon they avoid]"
- "[Overly sales-y language]"

## Best Post Examples
[Paste 2-3 of their best social posts here]
```

### 3. Document Their Positioning
**File**: `memory/knowledge-repo/positioning/doctor-[name].md`

```markdown
# Dr. [Name] - Positioning

## Specialty/Niche
[e.g., Long COVID, Autonomic Dysfunction, Chronic Illness]

## Target Patient (ICP)
[e.g., Long COVID sufferers seeking root cause treatment]

## Unique Approach
[What makes this doctor different from others]

## Treatment Philosophy
[Core beliefs about healing/medicine]

## Key Differentiators
1. [First unique element]
2. [Second unique element]
3. [Third unique element]
```

### 4. Add Values/Frameworks
**File**: `memory/knowledge-repo/values-beliefs/doctor-[name].md`

```markdown
# Dr. [Name] - Values & Frameworks

## Core Medical Beliefs
1. [Belief about root causes vs symptoms]
2. [Belief about patient empowerment]
3. [Belief about treatment approach]

## Mental Models/Frameworks
- [Framework they use to explain conditions]
- [Another mental model]

## What They Stand For
[Medical philosophy in 2-3 sentences]
```

**Time**: 15 minutes to fill these three files

## The First Content Generation (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Plan the Content (3 minutes)
```bash
/plan "Create social media post for Dr. [Name] about [topic they frequently post about]"
```

**Example:**
```bash
/plan "Create social media post for Dr. [Name] about autonomic dysfunction in long COVID patients"
```

The system will:
- Review the brand voice file
- Pull positioning and values
- Choose appropriate structure pattern
- Create systematic approach

### Step 2: Execute (5 minutes)
```bash
/work
```

The system will:
- Load context from memory
- Apply proven structure patterns
- Show reasoning process (you like to see this)
- Generate content using doctor's voice
- Include values/frameworks naturally

### Step 3: Quality Review (2 minutes)
```bash
/review
```

The system will:
- Check brand voice consistency
- Verify no untrue claims
- Ensure HIPAA compliance
- Review structure and flow
- Flag any issues before you edit

### Step 4: Minimal Editing (15-20 minutes)
**Focus On:**
- Fine-tune specific word choices
- Adjust for current timing
- Customize examples
- Verify medical accuracy
- Polish final details

**Don't Spend Time On:**
- ❌ Rewriting structure (should be correct)
- ❌ Fixing brand voice (should match)
- ❌ Adding positioning (should be integrated)
- ❌ Grammar/spelling (should be clean)

### Step 5: Capture Success (3 minutes)
```bash
/learn
```

The system will:
- Extract what made this successful
- Note editing patterns (what you changed)
- Update memory with insights
- Improve for next time

**Total Time**: ~30 minutes (vs current several hours)

## Success Validation

### You'll Know It Worked When:
1. ✅ Content matches doctor's voice without heavy rewriting
2. ✅ Values/positioning integrated naturally
3. ✅ Structure works (no major rearranging)
4. ✅ Editing took < 30 minutes
5. ✅ You're proud to publish it

### If It Didn't Work:
1. **Don't panic** - First attempt is calibration
2. **Review** what needed the most editing
3. **Update** the memory files with missing elements
4. **Try again** with improved context
5. **Expect** 2-3 iterations to dial it in

## Next Steps After Day-One Win

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Create 3-5 more posts** using same process
2. **Track editing time** for each
3. **Run `/learn`** after each successful piece
4. **Build pattern library** of what works

### Week 2-4 (Expand)
1. **Add 2-3 more doctor clients** to system
2. **Create brand files** for each
3. **Test consistency** across clients
4. **Measure improvement** (editing time trend)

### Month 2 (Scale)
1. **Share system with partner** for lead gen company
2. **Create versioned prompt library** (10+ prompts)
3. **Document all successful patterns**
4. **Enable doctor clients** (self-service content hub - stretch goal)

## Troubleshooting Your First Attempt

### Problem: Still Took 2+ Hours to Edit
**Likely Cause**: Memory files too sparse
**Solution**:
- Add 3-5 more example posts to brand voice file
- Document specific phrases doctor uses
- Include "voice notes" (how they speak uniquely)
- Add more values/frameworks
- Try again with richer context

### Problem: Tone Doesn't Match
**Likely Cause**: Generic brand template
**Solution**:
- Collect 5-10 of doctor's actual posts
- Analyze voice characteristics in detail
- Add "sounds like / doesn't sound like" examples
- Include personality descriptors
- Test voice-only before full generation

### Problem: Structure Needed Major Rework
**Likely Cause**: Wrong pattern for content type
**Solution**:
- Review the Long COVID example structure
- Choose pattern explicitly in prompt
- Use `/plan` to select structure before generation
- Document which patterns work for which topics

### Problem: Generic Positioning
**Likely Cause**: Positioning file too vague
**Solution**:
- Add 3-5 specific differentiators
- Include unique treatment philosophy
- Emphasize what competitors don't do
- Make positioning explicit in prompt
