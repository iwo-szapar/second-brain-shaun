# 📚 Experiences - Episodic Memory

**Your complete project history that feeds your Second Brain's intelligence.**

This is where every project you complete is stored with full context - the episodic memory that enables pattern extraction and continuous learning.

---

## 🎯 What Lives Here

Experiences contains your complete project history:
- **Full context** - Every plan, research note, output, review
- **Quality assessments** - 6-agent review scores and feedback
- **Extracted learnings** - Patterns discovered from each project
- **Chronological record** - Timeline of everything you've built

## 📂 Directory Structure

```
experiences/
├── INDEX.md (you are here)

## 🔄 The Experience Lifecycle

Every project follows this systematic cycle:

```
1. /plan [task]
   └─→ Creates: plan.md (research + execution steps)

2. /work [plan.md]
   └─→ Creates: research.md (gathered context)
   └─→ Creates: output.md (deliverable)

3. /review [output.md]
   └─→ Creates: review.md (6-agent quality assessment)

4. /learn
   └─→ Creates: learnings.md (extracted patterns)
   └─→ Updates: ../memory/patterns/ (compounds knowledge)
```

## 🚀 Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
1. Run `/plan [task description]`
2. System creates new project folder
3. System generates plan.md with research
4. Review plan, adjust if needed
5. Proceed to execution with `/work`

### Completing a Project
1. Run `/review [output.md]` for quality check
2. Review 6-agent feedback
3. Make improvements if needed
4. Run `/learn` to extract patterns
5. Check `learnings.md` for extracted wisdom

### Reviewing Past Projects
```
/recall [topic]
```
This searches experiences + memory for relevant context.

### Finding Similar Work
1. Browse `prospects/` for similar project types
2. Read their `plan.md` for approach
3. Check `output.md` for execution
4. Review `learnings.md` for patterns
5. Reference in new project

## 📊 Quality Tracking

### Score Interpretation
- **9-10**: Excellent - Publication ready
- **8-9**: Good - Minor improvements only
- **7-8**: Solid - Some refinement needed
- **6-7**: Adequate - Notable improvements needed
- **<6**: Needs work - Significant revision required

### Growth Pattern
Your scores should trend upward as patterns compound:
- **First 5 projects**: Baseline (typically 6-7)
- **Projects 5-10**: Improving (typically 7-8)
- **Projects 10-20**: Strong (typically 8-9)
- **20+ projects**: Expert (typically 9+)

Track trends: `../brain-health/quality-metrics.md`

## 🧩 Pattern Extraction

Every `/learn` cycle extracts patterns:

### What Gets Extracted
- **Messaging patterns** - Headlines, hooks, structures that worked
- **Positioning frameworks** - How you positioned the solution
- **Content structures** - Document organization that resonated
- **Research approaches** - Effective ways to gather context

### Confidence Levels
- **First use (LOW)**: Experimental, unvalidated
- **Second use (MEDIUM)**: Promising, likely reliable
- **Third+ use (HIGH)**: Validated, highly reliable

### Where It Goes
Extracted patterns → `../memory/patterns/`

---

## 🗂️ Organization Best Practices

### Project Naming
Use clear, descriptive names:
- ✅ `acme-corp-sales-deck-q4-2024`
- ✅ `prospect-email-sequence-saas`
- ❌ `project1`
- ❌ `deck`

### Folder Structure
Keep the standard structure:
```
[project-name]/
├── plan.md         # Always start here
├── research.md     # Context gathered
├── output.md       # Final deliverable
├── review.md       # Quality check
└── learnings.md    # Patterns extracted
```

### Archiving
Don't delete old projects - they feed the brain:
- Old projects remain valuable for `/recall`
- Past patterns inform future work
- Quality trends show growth

---

## 🔍 Finding Information

### By Project Type
Browse folders by naming pattern:
- Sales materials: `*-sales-*`
- Email sequences: `*-email-*`
- Presentations: `*-deck-*`, `*-presentation-*`

### By Quality Score
Check `../brain-health/quality-metrics.md` for:
- Highest scoring projects
- Recent quality trends
- Score distribution

### By Pattern
Use `/recall [pattern name]` to find:
- Projects using specific patterns
- How patterns evolved
- Validation history

---

## 🤖 Agent Usage

When AI agents work with experiences:

1. **They learn from history** - Agents reference past projects automatically
2. **They build on patterns** - Agents use validated approaches
3. **They measure quality** - Review agents provide consistent feedback
4. **They extract wisdom** - Learn agent identifies reusable patterns

---

## 📈 Growth Indicators

Your experiences folder shows brain growth:

### Early Stage (1-5 Projects)
- Building foundation
- Establishing baseline quality
- First pattern extractions

### Growth Stage (5-20 Projects)
- Quality scores improving
- Patterns reaching MEDIUM confidence
- Time savings emerging

### Mature Stage (20+ Projects)
- Consistent high quality (8-9+)
- Multiple HIGH confidence patterns
- Significant compound returns

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Starting projects**: Run `/plan [task]`
- **Quality checks**: Run `/review [output.md]`
- **Pattern extraction**: Run `/learn` after review
- **Finding past work**: Use `/recall [topic]`
- **Tracking growth**: Check `../brain-health/quality-metrics.md`

---

**💡 Remember**: Every project you complete makes the next one faster and better. This is episodic memory that feeds semantic knowledge extraction.
