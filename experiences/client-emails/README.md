# Client Email Experiences

> History of email drafting projects with learnings

---

## Purpose

Every client email drafted through the system gets saved here with context, outcome, and learnings. This builds episodic memory for future email improvements.

---

## Structure

**Per Email Project**:
```
[Date]-[ClientName]-[Topic]/
├── context.md       # What prompted the email
├── draft.md         # Generated email
├── sent.md          # Final sent version (with edits)
└── outcome.md       # Client response, result
```

**Optional**: For especially noteworthy emails, add `learnings.md`

---

## Usage Pattern

**After Drafting Email**:
1. If email achieved great outcome (fast response, project sold, relationship strengthened)
2. Save to this folder with context
3. After 5+ similar emails, run `/learn`
4. System extracts patterns to `memory/patterns/`

---

## Quick Commands

**Find Past Emails**:
```
/recall "Show client emails about workshop follow-ups"
```

**Extract Patterns**:
```
/learn
```

Run after 5+ emails drafted.
