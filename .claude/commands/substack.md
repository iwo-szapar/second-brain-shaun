## Step 1: Load Context & Voice

**Reading Damian's voice and values...**

I'll read these files to ensure authentic voice:
- `memory/style-voice/tone-guide.md` - Voice characteristics
- `memory/values-beliefs/core-values.md` - Core beliefs
- `memory/values-beliefs/frameworks.md` - Mental models (if populated)
- `memory/personal/expertise.md` - Areas of authority
- `.claude/skills/substack-writer/references/voice-patterns.md` - Quick voice reference
- `.claude/skills/substack-writer/references/structure-quick-reference.md` - Post structure
- `.claude/skills/substack-writer/references/validation-checklist.md` - Quality gates

---

## Step 2: Apply The Structure

**Using proven 7-part Substack structure:**

1. **Hook** (1 sentence) - Make people want to read
2. **Opening** (2-3 paragraphs) - Establish tension/question
3. **Core Insight** (1-2 paragraphs) - The main point
4. **Why This Matters** (2-3 paragraphs) - Connection to reader
5. **The Details** (3-5 sections) - Examples, frameworks, stories
6. **What This Means for You** (2-3 paragraphs) - Practical implications
7. **The Takeaway** (1-2 paragraphs) - Memorable closing

**Target**: 800-1500 words total

## Step 3: Write in Damian's Voice

**Applying voice characteristics:**

- ✅ **Authenticity**: Write from genuine experience, not generic advice
- ✅ **Values-Driven**: Connect to frameworks and beliefs
- ✅ **Strategic Depth**: Substantive thought leadership
- ✅ **Thoughtful & Exploratory**: "I've been thinking about..."

**Signature patterns to use:**
- Openings: "I've been thinking about...", "Something I've noticed..."
- Transitions: "Here's what this means...", "The deeper insight here is..."
- Closings: "The takeaway is...", "What this means for you..."

## Step 4: Validate Before Delivery

**Running validation checks:**

### Tier 1 (MUST PASS - Dealbreakers):
- [ ] Sounds authentically like Damian
- [ ] Reflects his values (authenticity, depth, context)
- [ ] Core insight is substantial, not obvious
- [ ] Appropriate length (800-1500 words)

### Tier 2 (SHOULD PASS - Quality Gates):
- [ ] Hook is compelling
- [ ] Structure flows naturally
- [ ] Examples are specific and concrete
- [ ] Takeaway is memorable

### Red Flags (if present, REVISE):
- ❌ Could have been written by anyone
- ❌ Uses corporate buzzwords without irony
- ❌ Core insight is obvious or surface-level
- ❌ Feels optimized for metrics, not meaning
