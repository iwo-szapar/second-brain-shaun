## What's Next?

### Option 1: Start Working (Recommended)

```bash
/plan [your first task]
```

Example:
```bash
/plan Create a one-pager for Acme Corp

This begins the compounding cycle:
```
/plan → /work → /review → /learn

```

### Option 2: Quick Help

## Tips for Getting the Most Value

1. **Complete the full cycle** - Don't skip /learn after projects
2. **Be specific in /plan** - "One-pager for Acme Corp" > "Create marketing materials"
3. **Trust /review** - 6 agents catch things you'll miss
4. **Check /grow weekly** - Watch your compound returns
