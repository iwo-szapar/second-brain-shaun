## Tips for /ask

**Good questions:**
- "Help me write a follow-up email to a prospect"
- "Draft a response to this objection: [objection]"
- "Summarize the key points for [topic]"
- "What's our positioning for [customer type]?"

**For bigger tasks, use /plan instead:**
- "Create a complete proposal" → `/plan Create proposal for X`
- "Build a presentation" → `/plan Build presentation about Y`
- "Research a competitor" → `/plan Research competitor Z`
