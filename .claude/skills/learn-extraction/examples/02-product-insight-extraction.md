# Example 2: Product Insight Extraction (UX Testing)

This example shows pattern extraction for product/UX work.

## Context
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Work Completed**: AI Coach interface user testing
**Domain**: Product (UX)
**Outcome**: Discovered UX issues before launch, avoided bad release

## Learn-Extraction Conversation (Abbreviated)

**Coach**: "You completed user testing for the AI Coach feature. What did you learn?"

**User**: "Tested with 6 users. 4 of them got confused by the same navigation element. Almost launched with a critical UX flaw."

**Coach**: "What specifically was confusing?"

**User**: "The 'Advanced Options' link. Users didn't know it was clickable. When they couldn't find settings, they gave up. I added a button style instead of text link. All 6 users found it immediately in the second test."

**Coach**: "Searching semantic memory for UX patterns..."

[Searches memory/semantic/product/ux-patterns.md]

**Coach**: "I found 'User Testing Protocol' (MEDIUM confidence, 3 examples). This sounds like a reinforcement. You:
- Tested with 5-8 users ✓ (6 users)
- Caught major issue before launch ✓
- Iterated and validated fix ✓

Is this a reinforcement of that pattern?"

**User**: "Yes, exactly. Followed the same protocol."

**Coach**: "What time did it save?"

**User**: "If we'd launched without testing, probably 10-15 hours of post-launch firefighting. Support tickets, emergency fixes, upset users."

**Coach**: "Perfect. Promoting pattern:

**Pattern**: User Testing Protocol
**Update**: MEDIUM (3 examples) → MEDIUM (4 examples)
**Time Saved**: 10-15 hours (prevented bad launch)
**New Finding**: Button styles > text links for critical actions

One more successful application will promote to HIGH confidence!

## Semantic Memory Update

```markdown
## User Testing Protocol

**Confidence**: MEDIUM (4 examples)  ← Incremented

**Last Applied**: 2025-10-18  ← Updated
**Times Applied**: 4  ← Updated

**Examples** (added):
- [2025-10-18 AI Coach Interface Testing](../episodic/product/2025-10-18-ai-coach-user-testing.md)

**Notes** (added insight):
- Critical UI elements should use button styles, not text links
- Users often don't recognize text links as interactive
```

## Episodic Memory Entry (Summary)

```markdown
# AI Coach Interface User Testing - 2025-10-18

**Domain**: Product (UX)

**What Happened**:
Conducted user testing on new AI Coach interface before launch. 6 users tested (3 consultants, 2 B2B users, 1 B2C).

**Outcome**:
- Caught critical UX flaw: "Advanced Options" text link not recognized as clickable
- 4/6 users gave up when they couldn't find settings
- Changed to button style, re-tested with 2 new users - both found it immediately
- Prevented bad launch

**Patterns Applied**:
- [User Testing Protocol](../../semantic/product/ux-patterns.md#user-testing-protocol) - Reinforced (4th time)

**Time Spent**: 3.5 hours (testing + iteration)
**Time Saved**: 10-15 hours (prevented post-launch support nightmare)

**What Worked**:
- Testing with 6 users (caught 100% of major issues)
- Quick iteration (changed design, re-tested same day)
- Mixed user segments (consultant + B2B + B2C)

**Next Time**:
- Default to button styles for all critical actions (not text links)
- Test navigation before visual design (interaction > aesthetics)

**Confidence Update**: User Testing Protocol reinforced (4th example, still MEDIUM)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Pattern reinforcement** (not new pattern)
2. **Time savings quantified** (10-15 hours prevented)
3. **Specific insight** (button > text link for critical actions)
4. **Progress tracking** ("One more for HIGH confidence!")
