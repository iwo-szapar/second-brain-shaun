## Multi-Domain Questions

Use when work spans multiple domains:

- "What surprised you most about today's work?"
- "What would you tell your past self before starting this?"
- "What made the biggest difference in the outcome?"
- "What pattern from one area applies to another?"
- "What did you learn that changes how you'll work going forward?"
- "What metric or measure would you track next time?"
- "What assumption did you validate or invalidate?"

## Follow-Up Probes

If initial answer is vague, ask:

**Instead of**: "It worked well"
**Ask**: "What metric improved? By how much?"

**Instead of**: "Users liked it"
**Ask**: "What did they say specifically? What did they do?"

**Instead of**: "It was faster"
**Ask**: "How much time did it take vs last time? What made it faster?"

**Instead of**: "I'd do it differently"
**Ask**: "What specifically would you change? Why?"

## Pattern Identification Cues

Listen for these signals that a pattern might be emerging:

- **Comparison**: "This time I did X instead of Y and got better results"
- **Consistency**: "This worked well, just like last time when I..."
- **Surprise**: "I didn't expect that [outcome], but it makes sense because..."
- **Reusability**: "I could definitely use this approach again for..."
- **Time savings**: "This saved me [X hours] vs the usual way"
- **Metrics**: "The [metric] was [Y%] compared to baseline of [Z%]"
- **Context**: "This works best when [specific conditions]"

When you hear these cues, dig deeper to extract the full pattern.
