# Substack Post Validation Checklist

> Quality gates before delivering any Substack post

---

## Pre-Delivery Validation

Before delivering any Substack post to Damian, verify it passes ALL of these checks:

---

## 1. Voice Authenticity ⭐ CRITICAL

### Sounds Like Damian
- [ ] Would pass the "remove the name" test - his audience would recognize this as his writing
- [ ] Uses his thought patterns: "I've been thinking about...", "Something I've noticed..."
- [ ] Reflects genuine perspective, not generic thought leadership
- [ ] Matches his exploratory, thoughtful tone

### Uses His Vocabulary
- [ ] Incorporates his signature phrases naturally
- [ ] Avoids corporate speak and buzzwords
- [ ] Language feels authentic to how he communicates
- [ ] Technical depth appropriate for his audience

### Reflects His Perspective
- [ ] Comes from genuine experience or observation
- [ ] Shows his unique angle on the topic
- [ ] Not something anyone could have written
- [ ] Personal without being overly confessional

### Appropriate Depth for Substack
- [ ] Substantive thought leadership, not surface takes
- [ ] 800-1500 words of actual content (not fluff)
- [ ] Builds frameworks, not just lists tips
- [ ] Rewards careful reading

---

## 2. Content Quality

### Hook Actually Hooks
- [ ] One compelling sentence that makes people want to read
- [ ] Sets up genuine tension or interesting question
- [ ] Not clickbait - delivers on the promise
- [ ] Strong enough to stand alone as a tweet

### Opening Establishes Clear Tension
- [ ] 2-3 paragraphs that draw reader in
- [ ] Establishes problem, question, or observation
- [ ] Provides enough context to understand why this matters
- [ ] Creates momentum toward the core insight

### Core Insight is Substantial
- [ ] Not obvious - offers new perspective
- [ ] Worth exploring in 800-1500 words
- [ ] Connected to Damian's expertise and values
- [ ] Can be articulated clearly in 1-2 paragraphs

### Examples Are Specific and Concrete
- [ ] Real scenarios, not hypotheticals
- [ ] Enough detail to be credible
- [ ] Illustrate the insight effectively
- [ ] Multiple examples from different angles

### Takeaway Is Memorable
- [ ] Reinforces main point without just repeating it
- [ ] Leaves reader with something to think about
- [ ] Circles back to hook or opens new question
- [ ] Ends on a strong note

---

## 3. Structure

### Flows Naturally
- [ ] Logical progression from section to section
- [ ] Each section builds on the previous one
- [ ] No jarring transitions
- [ ] Reader can follow the argument easily

### Each Section Advances the Argument
- [ ] No filler sections
- [ ] Every part serves the overall thesis
- [ ] Details support the core insight
- [ ] Implications flow from the details

### Proper Use of Breaks and Transitions
- [ ] Horizontal rules (---) separate major sections
- [ ] Subheadings break up long sections
- [ ] Transition sentences connect ideas
- [ ] White space aids readability

### Length Appropriate for Topic Depth
- [ ] 800-1500 words total
- [ ] Not padded - every paragraph earns its place
- [ ] Not rushed - gives ideas room to breathe
- [ ] The Details section is the longest (~40-50%)

---

## 4. Values Alignment ⭐ CRITICAL

### Reflects Authenticity Over Metrics
- [ ] Written for genuine value, not engagement optimization
- [ ] Substance over clickability
- [ ] True to Damian's perspective, not what's trending
- [ ] Quality over volume mindset

### Demonstrates Strategic Depth

## Quick Validation Tiers

### Tier 2: SHOULD PASS (Quality Gates)
If MULTIPLE of these fail, revise:

### Step 3: Content Validation (3 minutes)
Check each section:
- Hook → Opening → Core Insight → Why This Matters → Details → Implications → Takeaway
- Does each section deliver?
- Any weak spots?

### Step 4: Values Validation (1 minute)
Final alignment check:
- Authenticity over metrics? ✓
- Strategic depth? ✓
- Genuine value? ✓
- Brand integrity? ✓

### Step 5: Polish (as needed)

## When to Seek Clarification

Ask Damian for guidance if:
- Topic requires expertise beyond documented areas
- Unclear which framework or POV to apply
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Need specific examples from his experience
- Tone appropriate for topic is ambiguous

---

## Success Criteria

A Substack post is ready to deliver when:

1. ✅ Passes ALL Tier 1 checks (dealbreakers)
2. ✅ Passes MOST Tier 2 checks (quality gates)
3. ✅ Has NO red flags present
4. ✅ You would confidently publish this under Damian's name
5. ✅ It adds to his thought leadership, not just his content volume
6. ✅ Minimal editing needed - it's 95% ready to publish

---

## Post-Delivery Learning

After Damian reviews the post, note:
- What worked well (voice, structure, insights)
- What needed editing (voice calibration needed)
- His feedback patterns (what he consistently changes)
- Update tone-guide.md with observed preferences

This feedback loop makes every post better than the last.
