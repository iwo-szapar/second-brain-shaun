## The 7-Part Structure

### 1. Hook (1 sentence)
**Purpose**: Make people want to read
**Format**: Single compelling sentence after title
**Example**: `> "Most content feels hollow because we've optimized for volume over voice."`

**What works**:
- Provocative but substantive
- Sets up the tension
- Makes a claim worth exploring

---

### 2. Opening (2-3 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: Establish the problem, question, or tension
**Length**: 150-250 words

**What to include**:
- Context for why this matters now
- The question or tension you're exploring
- Why conventional wisdom falls short
- Personal observation that sparked this

**Structure**:
- Para 1: Set the scene / observation
- Para 2: Why this matters / the tension
- Para 3: What you're going to explore

---

### 3. The Core Insight (1-2 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: Your main point - the "why you're writing this"
**Length**: 100-200 words

**This is your thesis**:
- What you've discovered or realized
- The framework you're proposing
- The pattern you've identified
- Your contrarian take

**Make it substantive**: Not just "content is important" but "the content that works is built on preserved context, not template-filling"

---

### 4. Why This Matters (2-3 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: Connect the insight to the reader's world
**Length**: 150-250 words

**Answer these questions**:
- Why should the reader care?
- What changes for them with this insight?
- What problem does this solve?
- What opportunity does this create?

**Bridge from theory to practice**

---

### 5. The Details (3-5 sections)
**Purpose**: The meat of the post - examples, stories, frameworks
**Length**: 400-800 words (longest section)

**Could include**:
- **Examples**: Specific instances that illustrate the point
- **Stories**: Concrete narratives that make it real
- **Data**: Research or evidence that supports it
- **Contrarian takes**: Challenge assumptions
- **Frameworks**: Mental models to apply this

**Use subheadings** to break up this section:
```markdown
### The Pattern I'm Seeing

### Why This Happens

### A Framework for Thinking About This
```

---

### 6. What This Means for You (2-3 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: Practical implications
**Length**: 150-250 words

**Give readers**:
- Actionable insights (not just "do X")
- Questions to consider
- Perspective shifts
- Starting points

**Balance practical with thoughtful**: Not a checklist, but guided thinking

---

### 7. The Takeaway (1-2 paragraphs)
**Purpose**: Memorable closing that reinforces the main point
**Length**: 75-150 words

**Strong endings**:
- Circle back to the hook
- Reframe the original question
- Leave readers with a thought to carry forward
- Open a new question

**Avoid**: Summarizing everything you just said

---

## Section Transition Guidelines

### Between Opening and Core Insight
**Transition type**: Revelation
**Example**: "Here's what I've come to realize..."

### Between Core Insight and Why This Matters
**Transition type**: Connection
**Example**: "This matters because..."

### Between Why This Matters and The Details
**Transition type**: Exploration
**Example**: "Let me break this down..."

### Between The Details and What This Means for You
**Transition type**: Application
**Example**: "So what does this mean in practice?"

### Between What This Means for You and The Takeaway
**Transition type**: Elevation
**Example**: "The deeper point here is..."

## Length Guidelines

**Total Post**: 800-1500 words typically
- Shorter (800-1000): Single focused insight
- Medium (1000-1300): Framework with examples
- Longer (1300-1500): Complex topic with multiple angles

**Section breakdown** (approximate):
- Hook: 1 sentence
- Opening: 15-20%
- Core Insight: 10-15%
- Why This Matters: 15-20%
- The Details: 40-50%
- What This Means for You: 15-20%
- The Takeaway: 5-10%

## Formatting Best Practices

### Use breaks (---)
Separate major sections with horizontal rules:
```markdown
---
```

### Use subheadings
Break up long sections:
```markdown
### Subheading Here
```

### Short paragraphs
2-4 sentences max for readability

### Strategic bold
Emphasize key points:
```markdown
**The core insight**: [key point]
```

### Lists when appropriate
But don't overuse:
```markdown
**Three things I've noticed**:
- First observation
- Second observation
- Third observation
```

---

## Meta Information Template

Always end with meta information:

```markdown

**Tone**: [Analytical/Personal/Provocative]
**Audience**: [Who this is for]
**Key Message**: [One sentence summary]
