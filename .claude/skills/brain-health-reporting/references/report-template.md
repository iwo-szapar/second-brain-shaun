## 📊 Knowledge Growth This Week

### Patterns Discovered:
**New patterns**: [N] (added to semantic memory)
- [Pattern 1 name] (Domain: Growth, Confidence: LOW)
- [Pattern 2 name] (Domain: Product, Confidence: LOW)

### Patterns Reinforced:
**Updated patterns**: [N] (new examples added)
- [Pattern A] → Now [X] examples (still MEDIUM confidence)
- [Pattern B] → Now [Y] examples (promoted to HIGH ✨)

### Confidence Promotions:
- [Pattern X]: LOW → MEDIUM (2 examples now)
- [Pattern Y]: MEDIUM → HIGH (5 examples now)

### Total Pattern Count:
- **This week**: [N] patterns
- **Last week**: [M] patterns
- **Growth**: +[N-M] patterns ([X]% increase)

### Confidence Distribution:
- **HIGH** (5+ examples): [N] patterns ([X]%)
- **MEDIUM** (2-4 examples): [N] patterns ([Y]%)
- **LOW** (1 example): [N] patterns ([Z]%)

**Target by Month 6**: 40% HIGH, 40% MEDIUM, 20% LOW
**Current progress**: [On track / Ahead / Behind]

## 💡 Recommendations for Next Week

### Apply More HIGH Confidence Patterns:
You have [N] HIGH confidence patterns but only applied [M] this week.

**Underused patterns**:
- [Pattern X] (HIGH confidence, last used [N] weeks ago)
- [Pattern Y] (HIGH confidence, never used since promotion)

💡 **Action**: Reference these proactively in morning check-ins next week.

### Validate Patterns Close to Promotion:
**Patterns 1 example from promotion**:
- [Pattern A] at 4 examples (needs 1 more for HIGH)
- [Pattern B] at 1 example (needs 1 more for MEDIUM)

💡 **Action**: Look for opportunities to apply these patterns this week.

### Develop Weak Domains:
[Domain] has [only X patterns / no HIGH confidence patterns / stale patterns].

💡 **Action**: Focus on [Domain] work next week to build more proven patterns.

### Archive or Test Stale Patterns:
**Patterns not used in 2+ months**:
- [Pattern X] (last used [Date])
- [Pattern Y] (last used [Date])

💡 **Action**: Archive to `_archive/` or test once more to validate relevance.
