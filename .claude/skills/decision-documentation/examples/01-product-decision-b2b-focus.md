# Decision: Focus B2B Over B2C for Q1 2025

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Context:** Product Strategy
**Participants:** Iwo, Product Team
**Status:** Active (Review: 2025-04-01)

---

## Decision Made

AI Maturity Index will focus on B2B sales (consultants, agencies) in Q1 2025 rather than direct-to-consumer individuals.

---

## Why This Decision?

### Problem
Limited resources - can't effectively target both B2B and B2C simultaneously.

### Options Considered
1. **B2C Focus** (Individuals taking assessment)
   - Pros: Larger market, viral potential
   - Cons: Lower LTV, harder to monetize, diffuse messaging

2. **B2B Focus** (Consultants/agencies) ✅ **CHOSEN**
   - Pros: Higher LTV, clearer value prop, multiplier effect
   - Cons: Longer sales cycle, smaller TAM

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Pros: Hedged bet
   - Cons: Split focus, diluted resources, confusing messaging

### Rationale
- Consultants have immediate monetization path (white-label assessments)
- Each B2B customer brings 10-100 B2C users organically
- Clearer positioning: "Assessment tool for consultants"
- Higher engagement: Consultants need this for their business

---

## Trade-offs Accepted

**Not doing (for now):**
- Consumer marketing campaigns
- App store presence
- Viral B2C features (social sharing, gamification)

**Gaining:**
- Focused messaging (consultant pain points)
- Partnership opportunities (agencies)
- Faster product-market fit validation

---

## Implementation Impact

**Affects:**
- Marketing: Rewrite website copy for B2B
- Sales: Focus LinkedIn outreach on consultants
- Product: Add white-label features, team reports

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update positioning in company brain/corporate/strategy.md
- [ ] Revise /interview-outreach targeting criteria
- [ ] Add "Team Reports" to product roadmap

---

## Review Criteria

**Revisit if:**
- B2B sales don't reach $10k MRR by March 2025
- B2C organic demand exceeds 1000 signups/month
- Competitor launches strong B2B offering

**Success metrics:**
- 10+ paying B2B customers by March 2025
- Average customer brings 20+ users
- 80% of revenue from B2B

**Scheduled review:** April 1, 2025

## Notes
This decision doesn't preclude B2C growth - we're just not actively marketing to individuals. Organic B2C growth via consultant customers is encouraged.
