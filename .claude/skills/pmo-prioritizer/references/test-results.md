## Key Insights from Test Run

### ✅ Algorithm Working Correctly

1. **Urgency Detection**: Tasks with deadlines scored higher (Thursday presentation = 8, Week 1 tasks = 7)
2. **Impact Weighting**: HIGHEST priority tasks correctly scored 10/10
3. **Effort Inversion**: Quick wins (30 min) scored 10/10 effort, large tasks (3+ hrs) scored 4/10
4. **Alignment Recognition**: Tasks linked to critical projects got alignment bonuses
5. **Today's Focus Threshold**: Only tasks >= 75 made it to top tier (1 task)
6. **Quick Win Identification**: 30-minute task flagged even though score was 59

### 🔍 Observations

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation between Today (79), This Week (63-73), and Quick Wins (59)
- High-impact + quick tasks (Move Crisis finding) correctly prioritized at top
- Large time blocks (3+ hours) appropriately ranked lower despite high priority
- Quick wins correctly identified for gap-filling

**Edge Cases Identified**:
1. **Missing Due Dates**: Many tasks have no due date, defaulting to 5/10 urgency
   - Recommendation: Add due dates to improve prioritization accuracy
2. **Broad Priority Labels**: "HIGHEST" vs "HIGH" vs "MEDIUM" are subjective
   - Recommendation: Use CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW consistently
3. **Estimated Time Ranges**: "3-4 hours" requires averaging
   - Recommendation: Use single values (e.g., "Estimated: 210" for 3.5 hours)

### 📊 Algorithm Tuning Opportunities

Current weights work well, but could consider:

**If you want to favor quick wins more**:
```python
weights = {
    "urgency": 0.30,    # Reduce from 0.35
    "impact": 0.25,     # Keep same
    "effort": 0.25,     # Increase from 0.15
    "alignment": 0.10,  # Reduce from 0.15
    "momentum": 0.10    # Keep same
}
```
This would boost task #5 (screenshots) from 59 to ~65, moving it into "This Week" tier.

**If you want more deadline-driven prioritization**:
```python
weights = {
    "urgency": 0.45,    # Increase from 0.35
    "impact": 0.25,     # Keep same
    "effort": 0.10,     # Reduce from 0.15
    "alignment": 0.10,  # Reduce from 0.15
    "momentum": 0.10    # Keep same
}
```
This would boost Thursday presentation from 67 to ~71.

## Recommendations Based on Test

### For Immediate Use

1. **Add Due Dates**: Many tasks lack due dates, limiting urgency scoring
   - Example: "Add Claude Code Tricks" could have "Due: 2025-11-25"

2. **Standardize Priority Format**: Use CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW consistently
   - Convert "HIGHEST" → "CRITICAL"
   - Add priority to tasks missing it

3. **Use Single Time Estimates**: Replace "3-4 hours" with "Estimated: 210" (minutes)

4. **Add Goal Links**: Include `Links: [[Goal-Name]]` for strategic tasks
   - Example: Tutorial tasks could link to `[[Claude-Code-Tutorial-2025]]`

### Task Metadata Template

```markdown
- [ ] Task description
  Priority: HIGH
  Due: 2025-11-25
  Estimated: 120
  Links: [[Q4-Goals]], [[Tutorial-Project]]
  Status: active
```

This format maximizes scoring accuracy.
