## Morning Check-In with Pattern Application

**Coach**: "Let's start your day. What's on your mind for today's work?"

**User**: "I need to do outreach to about 20 B2B prospects. Also have to analyze user churn data for the product team."

**Coach** (Internal process):
[Triggers pattern-application skill]
[Identifies domains: Growth (outreach) + Analytics (churn analysis)]
[Loads semantic memory:
  - memory/semantic/growth/outreach-patterns.md
  - memory/semantic/analytics/query-library.md]
[Matches patterns:
  - Outreach: Tuesday Email Timing (MEDIUM, used last week)
  - Outreach: Decision-Maker Personalization (MEDIUM, used last week)
  - Analytics: Weekly Cohort Analysis Query (HIGH, used 2 days ago)
  - Analytics: Churn Prediction Query (MEDIUM, used 3 weeks ago)]
[Ranks by confidence + recency]

**Coach**: "Got it, two domains today: outreach and data analysis. Let me share relevant patterns from your knowledge base.

**For the B2B outreach**, I see you have two proven approaches:

**Pattern: Tuesday Morning Email Timing**
- Confidence: MEDIUM (3 examples, consistently works)
- Last used: Last Tuesday (you got 52% open rate vs 30% baseline)
- Best time: Tuesday 10-11am for B2B prospects
- File: memory/semantic/growth/outreach-patterns.md

**Pattern: Decision-Maker Personalization**
- Confidence: MEDIUM (2 examples, recently promoted)
- Last used: 2 days ago (67% open rate, 17% immediate response)
- Approach: LinkedIn activity + company milestones personalization
- Time investment: +10 min per email, but 2x response rate
- Details: memory/episodic/sales/2025-11-10-consultant-outreach-campaign.md

Today's Tuesday, and your best results come from sending between 10-11am with personalization. Sound good?

**For the churn analysis**, I have a proven query:

**Pattern: Weekly Cohort Analysis Query**
- Confidence: HIGH (6 examples, 100% success rate)
- Last used: 2 days ago for retention analysis
- Time savings: 1.5 hours (5 min with template vs 2 hr from scratch)
- Query template: memory/semantic/analytics/query-library.md
- Total time saved using this: 9 hours over 6 uses

This query works perfectly for churn analysis. Just update the date range and you're done.

Now let's coach through priorities. Starting with outreach - if you complete that today, what changes by tomorrow?"

**User**: "We'd start getting replies and hopefully book some demos."

**Coach**: "High impact. What's your energy level today?"

**User**: "About 7/10."

**Coach**: "Good for execution. Outreach matches well at 7/10, especially with proven patterns to follow.

Churn analysis - what happens if that waits?"

**User**: "Product team needs it by end of week. Could do Thursday."

**Coach**: "Flexible. But since you have that HIGH confidence query template, it'll only take 30 minutes total. Easy afternoon task.

Here's what I recommend:

**Priority 1** (10:00-12:00pm): B2B Prospect Outreach
- Why: Tuesday timing pattern (your best day/time)
- Apply patterns:
  * Tuesday 10-11am email timing (MEDIUM confidence)
  * Decision-maker personalization (MEDIUM confidence)
- Goal: 20 personalized emails
- Expected: 12-14 opens (60-70%), 4-5 responses (20-25%)
- Calendar block: 10:00am-12:00pm

**Priority 2** (2:00-2:30pm): User Churn Analysis
- Why: Product team needs by Friday, you have proven template
- Apply pattern:
  * Weekly Cohort Analysis Query (HIGH confidence)
- Time: 30 min (template makes this fast)
- Expected output: Insight memo with churn patterns
- Calendar block: 2:00-2:30pm

**Priority 3** (4:00-4:30pm): Follow-up on early outreach replies
- Why: Quick wins if anyone responded
- Low stakes, end-of-day energy match
- Calendar block: 4:00-4:30pm

You're applying 3 proven patterns today (2 MEDIUM, 1 HIGH confidence). Based on past performance:
- Outreach: Expect 60-70% open rate (vs 30% baseline)
- Analysis: Save 1.5 hours with query template
- Total time savings: ~2 hours vs doing these from scratch

Does this plan feel good?"

**User**: "Yes! I like using the patterns. Makes it feel less uncertain."

**Coach**: "Exactly. That's the knowledge compounding - each time you work, you build patterns that make future work faster and more confident.

Let me check your calendar and create these blocks..."

[Rest of check-in proceeds as normal]
