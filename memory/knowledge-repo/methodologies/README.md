# Methodologies

> Your proven processes, systems, and approaches for delivering work.

## What Goes Here

### Include
- ✅ Your consulting methodology
- ✅ Workshop/training delivery process
- ✅ Content creation workflows
- ✅ Client onboarding systems
- ✅ Project delivery frameworks
- ✅ Quality assurance processes

### Don't Include
- ❌ Mental models (those go in `/frameworks/`)
- ❌ Quick tactical checklists (those go in `/playbooks/`)
- ❌ Generic project management (only your unique approach)
