# Knowledge Repository

> Your personal wiki of frameworks, methodologies, research, and tactical playbooks.

---

## Purpose

This repository stores **codified knowledge** - the frameworks, systems, and insights you've developed or learned that inform your work. Unlike examples (which show your voice) or patterns (which emerge from projects), this is your explicit knowledge base.

**What belongs here**:
- ✅ Frameworks you've created or adapted
- ✅ Research and industry insights you reference
- ✅ Tactical playbooks and processes
- ✅ Best practices and standards
- ✅ Methodologies and systems
- ✅ Tools and resources you recommend

**What doesn't belong here**:
- ❌ Project-specific work (goes in `/experiences/`)
- ❌ Examples of your content (goes in `/memory/examples/`)
- ❌ Personal values/beliefs (goes in `/memory/values-beliefs/`)

## How to Use This Repository

### When Creating Content
Before writing, AI can reference:
- Relevant frameworks from `frameworks/`
- Methodologies from `methodologies/`
- Research to support claims from `research/`

### When Advising Clients
AI can pull from:
- Proven playbooks from `playbooks/`
- Best practices and standards
- Tools and resources to recommend

### When Answering Questions
AI cross-references:
- Your frameworks (your unique POV)
- Research (evidence base)
- Methodologies (how you work)

## Integration with Memory System

The knowledge repository works alongside other memory components:

### Knowledge Repo ↔ Values/Beliefs
- Your frameworks should reflect your core values
- Cross-reference: `memory/values-beliefs/core-values.md`

### Knowledge Repo ↔ Examples
- Examples demonstrate frameworks in action
- Cross-reference: `memory/examples/` for applied versions

### Knowledge Repo ↔ Patterns
- Patterns emerge from repeated framework application
- Cross-reference: `memory/patterns/` for learned patterns

### Knowledge Repo ↔ Style/Voice
- Methodologies inform how you structure content
- Cross-reference: `memory/style-voice/structure.md`

---

## Maintenance
