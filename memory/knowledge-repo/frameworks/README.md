> Your unique frameworks and mental models that define how you see and solve problems.

## What Goes Here

Frameworks are **mental models** that help you (and your clients) understand complex topics, make decisions, or evaluate situations. They're your unique POV codified into reusable thinking tools.

### Include
- ✅ Frameworks you've created or significantly adapted
- ✅ Visual models and diagrams
- ✅ "How to think about X" structures
- ✅ Decision-making frameworks
- ✅ Evaluation models

### Don't Include
- ❌ Step-by-step processes (those go in `/methodologies/`)
- ❌ Tactical checklists (those go in `/playbooks/`)
- ❌ Generic industry frameworks without your adaptation
