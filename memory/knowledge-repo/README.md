# Knowledge Repository

> Your vault for values, beliefs, frameworks, concepts, and valuable thoughts that kept getting lost.

## Purpose

**Shaun's Core Need**:
> "I have so many inputs and thoughts that are super valuable. But they often get lost in my notes. Many tries of structuring and organizing them were unsuccessful."

This folder solves:
- ✅ Prevent valuable thoughts from getting lost
- ✅ Searchable repository of values and beliefs
- ✅ Frameworks accessible when creating content
- ✅ Ideas captured and findable

## What Goes Here

### Values & Beliefs
**Why**: Content needs your values integrated, not just facts
**Format**: Core principles, medical philosophies, business beliefs
**Example**: "Root cause treatment > symptom management"

### Positioning
**Why**: Every doctor is unique - capture what makes them different
**Format**: Specialty, unique approach, differentiators
**Example**: "First practice to focus exclusively on autonomic dysfunction in long COVID"

### Frameworks
**Why**: Mental models make complex concepts accessible
**Format**: Explanatory frameworks, analogies, teaching approaches
**Example**: "Autonomic system = gas pedal (sympathetic) + brake (parasympathetic)"

### Learning
**Why**: System improves over time by capturing what works
**Format**: Insights from `/learn` command after successful projects
**Grows**: Automatically as you complete work and run `/learn`

### Ideas Inbox
**Why**: Quick capture so thoughts don't get lost
**Format**: Raw inputs, incomplete thoughts, concepts to explore
**Review**: Weekly processing into structured knowledge

## Usage Pattern

### Capturing Valuable Thoughts
**When you have an insight:**
```bash
/ask "Capture this thought in my knowledge repo: [your insight]"
```

System will:
- Categorize (value/belief, framework, idea)
- Store in appropriate location
- Make searchable for future use

### Using During Content Creation
**System automatically:**
- Loads doctor's values/beliefs
- Applies relevant frameworks
- Integrates positioning
- Makes content feel authentic

**You can also:**
```bash
/recall "autonomic dysfunction frameworks"
```

### Weekly Processing
1. Review `ideas/inbox/` for unprocessed thoughts
2. Categorize and file properly
3. Extract patterns from recent work
4. Update frameworks with new insights

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Document Your Values (5 min)
Create: `values-beliefs/shaun-values.md`

**Include:**
- What you believe about AI and business
- Your approach to doctor marketing
- Medical content philosophy
- How you think about patient communication

### Step 2: Capture a Framework (3 min)
Create: `frameworks/content-structures.md`

**Include:**
- The Hook → Pattern Interrupt → Solution structure
- Any other proven patterns you use
- When to use each structure

### Step 3: Test Retrieval (1 min)
```bash
/recall "content structures"
```

Should return your documented frameworks.

**If it works**: Your knowledge is now searchable and reusable! ✅

## Growth Trajectory

### Week 1 (Baseline)
- Document first doctor's values/positioning
- Capture 1-2 proven content frameworks
- Create ideas inbox system

### Month 1 (Building)
- 3-5 doctor clients fully documented
- 5+ content frameworks captured
- Ideas regularly captured and processed

### Month 3 (Mature)
- 10+ frameworks searchable
- All doctor clients documented
- Pattern library mature
- Partner contributing to shared knowledge

### Month 6 (Compounding)
- Rich knowledge base prevents lost insights
- System suggests relevant frameworks automatically
- Valuable thoughts archived and accessible
- Knowledge growing faster than you could manually organize

**Status**: 🌱 Ready to prevent thoughts from getting lost
**Next**: Document first doctor's values and positioning
**Goal**: Never lose a valuable thought again
