## Pre-Send Checklist

### 1. Fact Verification ✓
Every claim must be verifiable:

- [ ] Company name spelled correctly
- [ ] Job title matches posting exactly
- [ ] Company facts come from LinkedIn or website
- [ ] No assumed or guessed information
- [ ] Recent news/updates are actually recent (check dates)
- [ ] Product/service descriptions match company's own language

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ "Industry-leading" without evidence
- ❌ Specific metrics not from source material
- ❌ Claims about company culture without evidence
- ❌ Assumed pain points or challenges

### 2. Hallucination Detection ✓
Common AI hallucination patterns to watch for:

- [ ] **Made-up statistics**: "95% of customers" when not in source
- [ ] **Invented quotes**: Attributing words to people
- [ ] **False specifics**: Exact dates, numbers, or names not in research
- [ ] **Assumed relationships**: "Your partnership with X" when not confirmed
- [ ] **Generic claims**: "Award-winning" without verification
- [ ] **Future predictions**: "You're planning to X" without source

**Test**: Can you cite the exact source for every claim?

### 3. Human Voice Test ✓
Does it sound like a real person wrote it?

- [ ] Read it out loud—does it flow naturally?
- [ ] Would you actually say these words?
- [ ] Is sentence structure varied (not robotic)?
- [ ] Are there personal touches (not just facts)?
- [ ] Does it avoid corporate jargon?
- [ ] Is there genuine enthusiasm (not fake)?

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Every sentence same length
- ❌ Overly formal language
- ❌ Generic phrases ("I am writing to express...")
- ❌ No personality or voice

### 4. Specificity Test ✓
Generic = AI. Specific = Human.

- [ ] Could this email work for another company? (Should be NO)
- [ ] Are there at least 2 company-specific details?
- [ ] Is there at least 1 role-specific detail?
- [ ] Do examples relate directly to the opportunity?
- [ ] Is the "why this company" section unique?

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ "Your innovative approach" (generic)
- ❌ "Industry leader" without specifics
- ❌ "Great company culture" without evidence
- ❌ Could apply to 100 companies

### 5. Tone Calibration ✓
Professional but human balance:

- [ ] Confident without arrogance
- [ ] Enthusiastic without desperation
- [ ] Professional without stiffness
- [ ] Warm without being casual
- [ ] Direct without being pushy

**Scale**: 1 (too casual) to 10 (too formal). Target: 5-7.
