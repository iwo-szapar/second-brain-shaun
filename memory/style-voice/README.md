# Style & Voice Templates

> Brand and tone templates for Shaun and all doctor clients.

---

## Purpose

This folder stores the authentic voice and communication style for:
1. **Shaun's personal brand** (for lead gen company)
2. **Each doctor client** (for content creation)

---

## Structure

```
style-voice/
├── README.md (this file)
├── shaun-voice.md (your personal brand)
└── doctor-[name].md (each client's brand)
```

---

## What Goes Here

### For Each Doctor Client
Create a file: `doctor-[name].md`

**Include:**
- Voice characteristics (tone, formality, personality)
- Sounds like / doesn't sound like examples
- 3-5 best post examples
- Key themes and language patterns
- Vocabulary preferences

**Why This Matters:**
Content generation uses these files to match doctor's authentic voice, reducing editing time from hours to minutes.
