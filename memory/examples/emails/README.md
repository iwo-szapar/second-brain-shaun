## Subject Line Patterns

Document your subject lines separately to teach AI your patterns:

**Cold Outreach**:
- `[Their content/work] + quick question`
- `Idea for [specific thing they're working on]`
- `[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out`

**Follow-Ups**:
- `Re: [original subject]` (keep thread)
- `One more thing on [topic]`
- `Closing the loop on this`

**Client Communication**:
- `[Project Name] - Week [X] Update`
- `Quick win from today's session`
- `Thought you'd appreciate this`
