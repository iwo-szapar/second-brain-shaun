## How to Use This Directory

### Adding New Examples
When you create something excellent:

1. **Copy the content** to the appropriate subdirectory
2. **Follow naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`
3. **Add context** at the top (why this is a good example)
4. **Update the README** in that subdirectory

### Quality Bar
Only include examples that:
- ✅ Represent your best work
- ✅ Received positive feedback or results
- ✅ Sound authentically like you
- ✅ Demonstrate the format well
- ❌ Don't add mediocre or "okay" examples

### Maintenance
- **Review quarterly**: Remove examples that no longer represent your current style
- **Keep fresh**: Add new examples as you create them
- **Stay selective**: 3-5 stellar examples per format is better than 20 average ones
