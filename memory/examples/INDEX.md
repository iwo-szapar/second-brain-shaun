## Overview

This directory stores your best work as reference examples. These examples:

1. **Train the brain** on your brand voice and quality standards
2. **Inform `/plan`** with proven structures and approaches
3. **Guide `/review`** agents on what "good" looks like for you
4. **Accelerate future work** by providing templates to adapt

## How to Use Examples

### Adding Examples

When you create something excellent (review score 9+):

1. Copy the output to `memory/examples/[category]/`
2. Add a brief note about what makes it effective
3. Update this INDEX with the new example

### Using Examples

In `/plan`:
```
/plan [task] - reference examples in memory/examples/[category]
```

In `/recall`:
```
/recall example [topic]
```
