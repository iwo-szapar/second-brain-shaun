# Pattern Registry

> Your accumulated wisdom, organized for quick recall and application.

---

## How This Works

Every time you complete a `/learn` cycle, patterns get extracted and registered here. This INDEX enables:

1. **Fast Recall**: `/recall` searches this registry first
2. **Pattern Evolution**: Track confidence growth over time
3. **Application**: `/plan` references relevant patterns automatically

## Pattern Registry

| Pattern Name | Topic | Confidence | File | Date Added |
|-------------|-------|------------|------|------------|
| *No patterns yet* | - | - | - | - |

> **Tip**: Complete your first `/plan → /work → /review → /learn` cycle to populate this registry.

- None yet - run `/learn` after your first project

### Positioning
*Patterns for differentiation, value props, competitive framing*

- None yet - run `/learn` after your first project

### Objection Handling
*Patterns for addressing concerns and objections*

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| LOW | First observation | 1 successful use |
| MEDIUM | Emerging pattern | 2-3 successful uses |
| HIGH | Proven pattern | 4+ consistent successes |

### Confidence Progression

```
First success → LOW
    ↓
Second success → MEDIUM
    ↓
Third+ successes → HIGH
```

## Quick Navigation

### By Confidence

**HIGH Confidence** (Proven, always apply):
- *None yet*

**MEDIUM Confidence** (Emerging, consider applying):
- *None yet*

**LOW Confidence** (New, test and validate):
- *None yet*

### By Recency

**This Week**:
- *None yet*

**This Month**:
- *None yet*

## Pattern File Structure

Each pattern file follows this format:

```markdown
### [Pattern Name]

**Confidence**: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
**Source**: [experiences/path/to/source]
**Date**: [when discovered]

**Context**: When to use this pattern
[Situation where this applies]

**Pattern**: The reusable approach
[The actual pattern or template]

**Evidence**: Why we know it works
- [Evidence 1]
- [Evidence 2]

**Example**:
[Concrete example of pattern in use]
```

## Growing Your Pattern Library

### Best Practices

1. **Complete full cycles** - Don't skip `/learn`
2. **Be specific** - Vague patterns aren't reusable
3. **Track evidence** - Each success strengthens confidence
4. **Review weekly** - Run `/grow` to see accumulation

### What Makes a Good Pattern

- **Repeatable**: Works across multiple situations
- **Specific**: Clear enough to apply
- **Evidenced**: Has proof it works
- **Actionable**: Can be directly applied

---

## Maintenance

### Weekly
- Run `/grow` to review pattern health
- Note patterns ready for confidence upgrade

### Monthly
- Archive patterns that no longer apply
- Consolidate similar patterns
- Update examples with recent successes
