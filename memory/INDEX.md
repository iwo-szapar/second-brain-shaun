# 💾 Memory - Semantic Knowledge Base

**Your reusable business context that compounds with every project.**

This is where your Second Brain stores facts, frameworks, and patterns - the semantic knowledge that makes every future project faster and better.

---

## 🎯 What Lives Here

Memory contains everything you know that should be reused:
- **Company context** - What you do, how you do it, why it matters
- **Customer intelligence** - Who they are, what they need, why they buy
- **Patterns** - Extracted wisdom from completed projects (/learn)
- **Examples** - Winning artifacts worth referencing

## 🗂️ Subdirectory Index

### 🏢 [Company](./company/)
Your business context - what you do, how you do it, why it matters.

**Files:**
- `products.md` - What you offer (features, benefits, pricing)
- `positioning.md` - How you position yourself in the market
- `differentiators.md` - What makes you different from competitors

**When to Update:**
- Launching new products or features
- Refining positioning strategy
- Discovering new differentiators

### 👥 [Customers](./customers/)
Deep understanding of who you serve and what they need.

**Files:**
- `ideal-customer-profile.md` - Demographics, firmographics, psychographics
- `pain-points.md` - Problems they face that you solve
- `objections.md` - Common concerns and how to address them

**When to Update:**
- After customer interviews or sales calls
- When discovering new pain points
- When encountering new objections

### 🧩 [Patterns](./patterns/)
Extracted wisdom that compounds - grows automatically with `/learn`.

**Contains:**
- Messaging patterns that work
- Positioning frameworks that resonate
- Sales approaches that convert
- Content structures that engage

**How It Grows:**
Every time you run `/learn` after completing a project, the system:
1. Analyzes what worked
2. Extracts reusable patterns
3. Adds them here for future use

**Pattern Confidence Levels:**
- **HIGH** - Validated 3+ times, highly reliable
- **MEDIUM** - Validated 2 times, generally reliable
- **LOW** - Validated once, experimental

### 📚 [Examples](./examples/)
Winning artifacts worth referencing in future work.

**Contains:**
- Best email templates
- Successful one-pagers
- High-converting copy
- Effective presentations

**How to Use:**
Reference these when starting similar projects to maintain quality and speed.

## 🚀 Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
1. Read relevant company context from `company/`
2. Review customer intelligence from `customers/`
3. Check `patterns/` for relevant approaches
4. Browse `examples/` for reference material
5. Run `/plan` with this context

### Updating Company Context
1. Edit files in `company/` or `customers/` as needed
2. Be specific and concrete
3. Include examples where possible
4. Keep it current and accurate

### Building Your Pattern Library
1. Complete projects using the 4-command workflow
2. Run `/review` to assess quality
3. Run `/learn` to extract patterns
4. Watch `patterns/` grow automatically
5. Check confidence levels in `pattern-confidence.md`

### Curating Examples
1. After completing high-quality work
2. Save the best artifacts to `examples/`
3. Add context about why it worked
4. Reference them in future projects

## 📊 Memory Health

Your memory gets stronger over time:

### Foundation Phase (First 5 Projects)
- Fill basic company and customer context
- Start pattern extraction with `/learn`
- Save first winning examples

### Growth Phase (Projects 5-20)
- Patterns reach MEDIUM confidence
- Examples library covers common scenarios
- Time savings become noticeable

### Compound Phase (20+ Projects)
- Multiple HIGH confidence patterns
- Rich examples library
- Significant time savings on repeat work

## 🔍 Finding Information

### Quick Navigation
- **Company basics**: `company/products.md`
- **Customer info**: `customers/ideal-customer-profile.md`
- **All patterns**: `patterns/INDEX.md`
- **Best examples**: `examples/INDEX.md`

### Search Past Work
```
/recall [topic]
```
This searches both memory and past experiences for relevant context.

## ✏️ Editing Guidelines

### Keep It Concrete
❌ "We help companies improve"
✅ "We help B2B SaaS companies reduce sales cycles from 90 to 45 days"

### Use Examples
❌ "Our customers are enterprise companies"
✅ "Our customers are enterprise companies (500-5000 employees) like Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle"

### Stay Current
- Review quarterly
- Update after major changes
- Remove outdated information

### Be Specific
The more specific your context, the better your brain's output.

## 🤖 Agent Usage

When AI agents work with your memory:

1. **They read first** - Agents pull context before generating
2. **They reference patterns** - Agents use extracted patterns automatically
3. **They cite examples** - Agents reference winning examples when relevant
4. **They update via /learn** - Agents extract new patterns after project completion

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Getting started**: Fill `company/` and `customers/` basics
- **Pattern extraction**: Run full workflow (plan → work → review → learn)
- **Building examples**: Save your best work with context
- **Checking growth**: View `../brain-health/pattern-confidence.md`

**💡 Remember**: This is your semantic knowledge base. The more specific and concrete you make it, the better your brain performs.
