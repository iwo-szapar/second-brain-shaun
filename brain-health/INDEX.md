## 🚀 Common Workflows

### Checking Brain Growth
```
/grow
```
This command reads all three files and provides:
- Total patterns extracted
- Confidence level breakdown
- Quality score trends
- Time savings estimate

### After Pattern Extraction
When `/learn` completes:
1. Check `pattern-confidence.md` for new pattern
2. Review confidence level
3. Read `growth-log.md` for timeline entry
4. Celebrate compound growth! 🎉

### Before Starting Work
Check `pattern-confidence.md` to see:
- What patterns are available
- Which are most reliable (HIGH confidence)
- When they were last used successfully

### Weekly Review
Every week, review:
1. `quality-metrics.md` - Are scores improving?
2. `pattern-confidence.md` - Are patterns validating?
3. `growth-log.md` - What changed this week?

## 📈 Growth Phases

Your brain health evolves through phases:

### Foundation Phase (Projects 1-5)
**Metrics**:
- 1-3 LOW confidence patterns
- Baseline quality scores (6-7)
- Initial timeline entries

**What's Happening**:

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

### Pattern Metrics
- **Total patterns**: Count in `pattern-confidence.md`
- **Confidence breakdown**: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH distribution
- **Validation rate**: Patterns gaining confidence over time
- **Success rate**: % of patterns with 8+ scores

### Quality Metrics
- **Average score**: Mean across all projects
- **Trend direction**: Improving, stable, or declining
- **Consistency**: % of projects scoring 8+
- **Agent-specific patterns**: Which agents consistently flag issues

### Time Metrics
- **Projects completed**: Total count
- **Pattern reuse**: How often patterns are applied

---

## 🎯 Improvement Targets

### Healthy Growth Indicators
✅ Quality scores trending upward
✅ New patterns validating to MEDIUM/HIGH
✅ Consistent 8+ scores on recent work
✅ Growing pattern library (1-2 new per 5 projects)

### Warning Signs
⚠️ Quality scores declining or stagnant
⚠️ No pattern validation progress
⚠️ Inconsistent scores (varying widely)
⚠️ No new patterns in 10+ projects

### Action Items for Improvement
If growth stalls:
1. **Review quality feedback** - What are agents consistently flagging?
2. **Refine memory context** - Is company/customer info specific enough?
3. **Complete the cycle** - Are you running full /plan → /work → /review → /learn?
4. **Study high scorers** - What made 9+ scoring projects successful?

## 🤖 Agent Usage

Agents automatically update brain health:

1. **`/review`** → Updates `quality-metrics.md`
2. **`/learn`** → Updates `pattern-confidence.md` and `growth-log.md`
3. **`/grow`** → Reads all three files for dashboard view

Manual updates:
- Add milestone entries to `growth-log.md`
- Note observations in metric files
- Track personal insights

## 🎓 Understanding the Data

### Pattern Confidence Math
```
LOW (1 validation) → "Try it, monitor carefully"
MEDIUM (2 validations) → "Likely reliable, use confidently"
HIGH (3+ validations) → "Proven approach, use as default"
```

### Quality Score Interpretation
```
9-10: Excellent (publish-ready)
8-9:  Good (minor improvements only)
7-8:  Solid (refinement recommended)
6-7:  Adequate (notable improvements needed)
<6:   Needs work (significant revision required)
```

### Compound Returns Calculation
```
Time saved = (baseline time - current time) × projects completed
Example: 60 min → 30 min × 20 projects = 600 minutes (10 hours) saved
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Check overall health**: Run `/grow`
- **Understanding metrics**: Read "Key Metrics to Track" above
- **Improving scores**: Review "Action Items for Improvement"
- **Pattern not validating**: Check if you're completing full `/learn` cycle
