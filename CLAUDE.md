## About Me

### Who I Am
- **Name**: Shaun
- **Role**: Solo entrepreneur (doctor marketing/websites) + building lead gen company with 2 partners
- **Technical Level**: Some CLI experience
- **AI Tools**: ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Codex
- **GitHub**: BioRevGrowth
- **Focus**: AI-first operations and quality content creation

### What I Do
I help doctors with their marketing and websites while building an AI-first lead generation company with 2 partners. I'm creating a comprehensive system to manage all AI operations - with versioned prompts, brand templates for myself and all clients, and a memory system for values, beliefs, and frameworks. My goal is to stop spending hours editing AI-generated content and instead produce publication-ready work.

### My Current Challenges
- **Fragile Organization**: Using Claude projects in silos that break easily
- **Context Repetition**: Adding same information repeatedly when creating new projects
- **Content Editing**: Spending several hours weekly editing social media posts and articles
- **Lost Knowledge**: Valuable inputs and thoughts get lost despite organization attempts
- **Setup Time**: Time required to properly configure MCPs and Claude skills
- **Missing Context**: Content needs writing style plus values, beliefs, and frameworks

### My Goals with This Brain
- **Quality Content Production**: Create social media posts and articles requiring minimal editing
- **AI Operations System**: Robust platform with versioned prompts and brand templates
- **Comprehensive Memory**: Store and access values, beliefs, frameworks, and positioning
- **Business Intelligence**: Quickly understand state of my business and client businesses
- **Knowledge Repository**: Prevent valuable thoughts and concepts from getting lost
- **Time Savings**: Reduce hours spent on marketing planning and content editing
- **Day-One Win**: Ability to produce quality content requiring minimal editing

## Best Practices

1. **Always /plan first** - Never jump straight into work
2. **Complete the cycle** - /plan → /work → /review → /learn
3. **Trust /review** - 6 agents catch what you miss
4. **Feed the brain** - Run /learn after every project
5. **Maintain discipline** - Only add well-structured documentation
